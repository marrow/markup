Installing @marrow.texting@ is easy, just execute the following in a terminal:

Development takes place on "GitHub":github in the "marrow.texting":github-project project.  Issue tracking, documentation, and downloads are provided there.

Installing the current development version requires "Git":git, a distributes source code management system.  If you have Git, you can run the following to download and _link_ the development version into your Python runtime:

(cd marrow.texting; python setup.py develop)</code></pre>

You can upgrade to the latest version at any time:
